## Project: Intro to Django
### Author: Student/Group Name

## Overview
In this class we’ll build out a small, but functional, multi-page web site using Django.

We’ll get a feel for the “Django Way” and see the dramatic performance gains you can get with a mature, robust framework.

Along the way, you’ll style your site in a new way using the utility-first framework TailwindCSS.

## Dependencies
- Make sure Python is installed on your machine.
- Install necessary Python packages from `requirements.txt` using the command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### How to initialize/run your application

python manage.py runserver
```

### How to use your library (where applicable)
